The `phylolmSEM` package implements piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM) for the R statistical language. SEM is useful for simultaneously testing complex multivariate hypotheses, and a piecewise approach (i.e., local estimation) is a flexible variant that allows for the fitting of various model forms and specifications. 

Users are able to construct a list of structured equations corresponding to a single caustal network using the most common linear modeling functions, including: `lm`, `rq`, `glm`, `glm.nb`, `gls`, `phylolm`, `merMod`, `merModLmerTest`, `lme`, `glmmPQL`, and `glmmadmb`. 

I provide functions to evaluate (`sem.fit`, `sem.model.fits`), solve (`sem.coefs`), and visualize (`partial.resid`) the output. I also provide a way for users to translate their network to a traditional variance-covariance based SEM as implemented in the `lavaan` package (`sem.lavaan`).

In this vignette, I provide a worked example, all the way from constructing the model to conducting tests of directed separation and interpreting the results.

##Example: Shipley (2009)

The following example comes from Shipley (2009)^[Shipley, B. (2009). Confirmatory path analysis in a generalized multilevel context. Ecology, 90(2), 363-368.]. The hypothetical data represent a study conducted beginning in 1970 across 20 sites differing in latitude (`lat`). Five individual trees are measured each year until 2006 (or until the tree dies). At each site in each year and for each individual, the following variables are measured: the cumulative degree days until bud break (`Date`), the Julian date of bud break (`DD`),  the increase in stem diameter per tree (`Growth`) and a binary variable indicating the survival (`1`) or death (`0`) in the subsequent growing season (`Live`).

This dataset incorporates hierarchical observations (individual within site within year) and non-independence (repeated measures), and therefore violates some of the basic assumptions of traditional linear modeling and variance-covariance SEM, making it a perfect candidate for a piecewise approach.

The hypothesized casual structure of the network is specified by Shipley as:
![Shipley 2009 Fig. 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jslefche/jslefche.github.io/master/img/shipley_2009.jpg)
and will be the structure we will evaluate in this example.

###Load package

```{r, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# library(devtools)
# install_github("jslefche/piecewiseSEM")
library(piecewiseSEM)
```

###Load data from Shipley 2009

```{r}
data(shipley2009)
```
The data is alternately hosted in Ecological Archives E090-028-S1 (DOI: 10.1890/08-1034.1).

###Create model set

`sem.fit` returns a list of the following:
(1) the missing paths (omitting conditional variables), the estimate, standard error, degrees of freedom, and associated p-values;
(2) the Fisher's C statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value for the model (derived from a Chi-squared distribution);
(3) the AIC, AICc (corrected for small sample size), the likelihood degrees of freedom, and the model degrees of freedom.

The argument `add.vars` allows you to specify a vector of additional variables whose causal independence you also wish to test. This is useful if you are comparing nested models. Default is `NULL`.

The argument `adjust.p` allows you to adjust the p-values returned by the function based on the the total degrees of freedom for the model (see supplementary material, Shipley 2013). Default is `FALSE` (uses the d.f. reported in the summary table).
